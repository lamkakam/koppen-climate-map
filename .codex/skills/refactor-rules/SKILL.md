# Refactor Rules
- Refactor with a safety net of tests. If the refactor is not fully covered by existing tests, add new tests before refactoring.
- Always work on a refactor branch. Never work on main branch
- Do not change existing behavior or add new features in a refactor PR
- All type checking and linting must be passed
- In TypeScript, use `undefined` instead of `null` whenever possible
- When including link to any GitHub page, always use the domain name `redirect.github.com`. Never use the domain name of `github.com`
- End your commit message with "Co-Authored-By: <model-name-with-precise-version-number, eg. GPT-5.5> with an email address "no-reply@<domain-name>" for auditing purpose
